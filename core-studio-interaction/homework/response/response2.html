&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;“Metalogue: Why a Swan?” Speaks about the differences between the terms “sort of” and “is”. “Sort of” can be implied that the person described did not try hard enough to be the thing they wanted to be. The term means that there is still something to be desired in the performance. Being the thing and being acknowledged for it might be a sign of respect for committing to the role. “Metaphors We Live By” talks through various metaphors that are prevalent in everyday life. “Argument is War” in how there are wins and losses, verbal conflict, and attacks. This metaphor falls into a category were argument can be described with words associated with war. “Time is money” doesn’t relate to each other in that way. Rather it is a metaphor due to how time is a commodity that people use today and a limited resource. To see it even more literal there can be a line drawn between wages and how the more time you spend the more money you might make.  Orientational Metaphors rather depend largely on the culture were it is being said. The previous two might have been able to be explained but happy corresponding with up and sad with down is much more intimate and cultural affair.
