The Library of Babel talks about an alternate universe containing almost an entity of the universe within something called The Library.  It is the idea of extreme order, everything being constant and parallel to eatherother. While it contains everything it also contains nothing as it is almost impossible to find information you want to seek. This leading people into insanity Due to the fact that it is infinite it creates a whole world within the Library inself.  It speaks to the fact that this is what can happen when perhaps people try to find all the reasons behind the happenings of the universe? Or perhaps It just shows how little people know about the going ons of the universe and infinity.<br>

The Tower of Babylon perhaps is a celebration of the human spirit anode its work. The men fell under Yahweh in fear of what he might think seeing the men seemingly disobey him.  They thought that Yahweh would be mad in that they are striving for more but at the end knowing that his love made it that he proud of his creations.  Reminds me of the enlightenment where the world became more humanist in their way of loving god. The way that where you pursue greater things and that is showing how much you love God.<br>

I did not understand the first reading.
