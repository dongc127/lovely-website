2. With this introduction to Javascript I  was crusing though the buttons and changing the background colors.  I had alot of trouble with any other functions. My onmouseclick only worked sometimes and I felt like I wanted  a click to keep changing the  color but I didnt know how  to make the function go though a list. There are various other functions that I had trouble with so I made them into comments to  try and go back to it later.

3. I can not get any of my jquery code to work :( . I know my js document is working because my console.log is working. All i have on my js doc is code that theoretically should be working.
